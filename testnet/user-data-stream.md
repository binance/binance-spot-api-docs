# User Data Streams for Binance Spot TESTNET

**Last Updated: 2025-04-08**

# General WSS information

* There are currently two ways to subscribe to the User Data Stream:
  * **[Preferred]** Subscribing directly through the [WebSocket API](web-socket-api.md#user-data-stream-subscribe) using an API Key.
  * **[Deprecated]** Generating a **listen key** using [the REST API](rest-api.md#user-data-stream-requests) or [the WebSocket API](web-socket-api.md#user-data-stream-requests) and using it to listen on **stream.binance.com**
* Both sources will push all events related to your account **in real-time**.
* How to use a listen key on **stream.testnet.binance.vision**:
  * The base endpoint is: **wss://stream.testnet.binance.vision:9443** or **wss://stream.testnet.binance.vision:443**.
  * A single connection to **stream.binance.com** is only valid for 24 hours; expect to be disconnected at the 24 hour mark.
  * User Data Streams are accessed at **/ws/\<listenKey\>** or **/stream?streams=\<listenKey\>**
  * All time and timestamp related fields in the JSON payload are **milliseconds by default**. To receive the information in microseconds, please add the parameter `timeUnit=MICROSECOND` or `timeUnit=microsecond` in the connection URL.
    * For example `/ws/<listenKey>?timeUnit=MICROSECOND`

## User Data Stream Events
### Account Update

`outboundAccountPosition` is sent any time an account balance has changed and contains the assets that were possibly changed by the event that generated the balance change.

```javascript
{
  "e": "outboundAccountPosition", // Event type

#### Order Reject Reason

For additional details, look up the Error Message in the [Errors](errors.md#other-errors) documentation.

|Rejection Reason (`r`)| Error Message|
|---             | ---          |
|`NONE`           | N/A (i.e. The order was not rejected.)|
|`INSUFFICIENT_BALANCES`|"Account has insufficient balance for requested action."|
|`STOP_PRICE_WOULD_TRIGGER_IMMEDIATELY`|"Order would trigger immediately."|
|`WOULD_MATCH_IMMEDIATELY`|"Order would immediately match and take."|
|`OCO_BAD_PRICES`|"The relationship of the prices for the orders is not correct."|

If the order is an order list, an event named `ListStatus` will be sent in addition to the `executionReport` event.

      "i": 18,
      "c": "bfYPSQdLoqAJeNrOr9adzq"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Execution types

* `NEW` - The order has been accepted into the engine.
* `CANCELED` - The order has been canceled by the user.
* `REPLACED` - The order has been amended.
* `REJECTED` - The order has been rejected and was not processed. (e.g. Cancel Replace orders where the new order placement was rejected even if the cancel request succeeded.)
* `TRADE` - Part of the order or all of the order's quantity has filled.
* `EXPIRED` - The order was canceled according to the order type's rules (e.g. LIMIT FOK orders with no fill, LIMIT IOC or MARKET orders that partially fill) or by the exchange, (e.g. orders canceled during liquidation, orders canceled during maintenance).
* `TRADE_PREVENTION` - The order has expired due to STP.

Check the [Enums Documentation](enums.md) for more relevant enum definitions.

### Listen Key Expired

This event is sent when the listen key expires.

No more events will be sent after this until a new `listenKey` is created.

This event will not be pushed when the stream is closed normally.

**Payload:**

```javascript
{
  "e": "listenKeyExpired",  // Event type
  "E": "1699596037418",     // Event time
  "listenKey": "OfYGbUzi3PraNagEkdKuFwUHn48brFsItTdsuiIXrucEvD0rhRXZ7I6URWfE8YE8"
}
```

### Event Stream Terminated

This event appears only for WebSocket API.

`eventStreamTerminated` is sent when the User Data Stream is stopped. For example, after you send a `userDataStream.unsubscribe` request, or a `session.logout` request.

**Payload:**

```javascript
{
  "event": {
    "e": "eventStreamTerminated", // Event Type
    "E": 1728973001334            // Event Time
  }
}
```

### External Lock Update

`externalLockUpdate` is sent when part of your spot wallet balance is locked/unlocked by an external system, for example when used as margin collateral.

**Payload:**

```javascript
{
  "e": "externalLockUpdate",  // Event Type
  "E": 1581557507324,         // Event Time
  "a": "NEO",                 // Asset
  "d": "10.00000000",         // Delta
  "T": 1581557507268          // Transaction Time
}```
