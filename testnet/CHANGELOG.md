### 2024-11-27

**Note:** These changes will be deployed live **starting 2024-11-28** and may take several hours for all features to work as intended.

**New Feature: Microsecond support:**

The system now supports microseconds in all related time and/or timestamp fields. Microsecond support is **opt-in**, by default the requests and responses still use milliseconds.<br></br> 
Examples in documentation are also using milliseconds for the foreseeable future.

WebSocket Streams

* A new optional parameter `timeUnit` can be used in the connection URL to select the time unit.  
  * For example: `/stream?streams=btcusdt@trade&timeUnit=millisecond`  
  * Supported values are:  
    * `MILLISECOND`  
    * `millisecond`  
    * `MICROSECOND`  
    * `microsecond`  
  * If the time unit is not selected, milliseconds will be used by default.

REST API

* A new optional header `X-MBX-TIME-UNIT` can be sent in the request to select the time unit.  
  * Supported values:  
    * `MILLISECOND`  
    * `millisecond`  
    * `MICROSECOND`  
    * `microsecond`
  * The time unit affects time-related parameters in requests (e.g, `startTime`, `endTime`, `timestamp`).  
  * The time unit affects timestamp fields in responses (e.g., `time`, `transactTime`).  
  * If the time unit is not selected, milliseconds will be used by default. 

WebSocket API

* A new optional parameter `timeUnit` can be used in the connection URL to select the time unit.   
  * Supported values:  
    * `MILLISECOND`   
    * `millisecond`  
    * `MICROSECOND`  
    * `microsecond`
  * The time unit affects time-related parameters in requests (e.g, `startTime`, `endTime`, `timestamp`).  
  * The time unit affects timestamp fields in responses (e.g., `time`, `transactTime`).  
  * If the time unit is not selected, milliseconds will be used by default. 

User Data Streams

* A new optional parameter `timeUnit` can be used in the connection URL to select the time unit.   
  * Supported values   
    * `MILLISECOND`   
    * `MICROSECOND`.  
    * `microsecond`  
    * `millisecond`

General Changes:

* Fixed a bug that prevented orders from being placed when submitting OCOs on the `BUY` side without providing a `stopPrice`.
* `TAKE_PROFIT` and `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` support has been added for OCOs.  
  * Previously OCOs could only be composed by the following order types:  
    * `LIMIT_MAKER` \+ `STOP_LOSS`  
    * `LIMIT_MAKER` \+ `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`  
  * Now OCOs can be composed of the following order types:  
    * `LIMIT_MAKER` \+ `STOP_LOSS`  
    * `LIMIT_MAKER` \+ `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`  
    * `TAKE_PROFIT` \+ `STOP_LOSS`  
    * `TAKE_PROFIT` \+ `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`   
    * `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` \+ `STOP_LOSS`  
    * `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` \+ `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`  
  * This is supported by the following requests:   
    * `POST /api/v3/orderList/oco`  
    * `POST /api/v3/orderList/otoco`  
    * `orderList.place.oco`  
    * `orderList.place.otoco`  
    * `NewOrderList<E>`  
  * Error code `-1167` will be obsolete after this update and will be removed from the documentation in a later update.
* Timestamp parameters now reject values too far into the past or the future. To be specific, the parameter will be rejected if:  
  * `timestamp` before 2017-01-01 (less than 1483228800000\)  
  * `timestamp` is more than 10 seconds after the current time (e.g., if current time is 1729745280000 then it is an error to use 1729745291000 or greater)  
* If `startTime` and/or `endTime` values are outside of range, the values will be adjusted to fit the correct range. 
* The field for quote order quantity (`origQuoteOrderQty`) has been added to responses that previously did not have it. Note that for order placement endpoints the field will only appear for requests with `newOrderRespType` set to `RESULT` or `FULL`. 

  * Please refer to the table for requests with `origQuoteOrderQty`:

  | Service | Request |
  | :---- | :---- |
  | REST | `POST /api/v3/order`  |
  |  | `POST /api/v3/sor/order`  |
  |  | `POST /api/v3/order/oco`  |
  |  | `POST /api/v3/orderList/oco`  |
  |  | `POST /api/v3/orderList/oto`  |
  |  | `POST /api/v3/orderList/otoco`  |
  |  | `DELETE /api/v3/order`  |
  |  | `DELETE /api/v3/orderList`  |
  |  | `POST /api/v3/order/cancelReplace` |
  | WebSocket API | `order.place`  |
  |  | `sor.order.place`  |
  |  | `orderList.place`  |
  |  | `orderList.place.oco`  |
  |  | `orderList.place.oto`  |
  |  | `orderList.place.otoco`  |
  |  | `order.cancel`  |
  |  | `orderList.cancel`  |
  |  | `order.cancelReplace` |

SBE

* A new schema 2:1 [spot_2_1.xml](https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/sbe/schemas/spot_2_1.xml) has been released. The current schema 2:0 [spot_2_0.xml](https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/sbe/schemas/spot_2_0.xml) will thus be deprecated, and retired from the API in 6 months as per our schema deprecation policy.  
* Schema 2:1 is a backward compatible update of schema 2:0. You will always receive payloads in 2:1 format when you request either schema 2:0 or 2:1.  
* Changes in SBE schema 2:1:  
  * New field `origQuoteOrderQty` in order placement/cancellation responses (Note: Decoders generated using the 2:0 schema will skip this field.):  
    * `NewOrderResultResponse`  
    * `NewOrderFullResponse`  
    * `CancelOrderResponse`  
    * `NewOrderListResultResponse`  
    * `NewOrderListFullResponse`  
    * `CancelOrderListResponse`  
  * WebSocket API only: New field `userDataStream` in session status responses:  
    * `WebSocketSessionLogonResponse`  
    * `WebSocketSessionStatusResponse`  
    * `WebSocketSessionLogoutResponse`  
  * WebSocket API only: New messages for User Data Stream support:  
    * `UserDataStreamSubscribeResponse`  
    * `UserDataStreamUnsubscribeResponse`  
    * `BalanceUpdateEvent`  
    * `EventStreamTerminatedEvent`  
    * `ExecutionReportEvent`  
    * `ExternalLockUpdateEvent`  
    * `ListStatusEvent`  
    * `OutboundAccountPositionEvent`

WebSocket API

* You can now subscribe to User Data Stream events through your WebSocket API connection.   
  * Note: This feature is only available for users of Ed25519 API keys.  
  * Note: New SBE schema 2:1 is required for User Data Stream subscriptions in SBE format.  
* New requests:  
  * `userDataStream.subscribe`  
  * `userDataStream.unsubscribe`  
* Changes to `session.logon`, `session.status`, and `session.logout`  
  * Added a new field `userDataStream` indicating if the user data stream subscription is active.   
* Fixed a bug where you wouldn't receive a new listenKey using `userDataStream.start` after `session.logon` 

User Data Stream

* WebSocket API only: New event `eventStreamTerminated` is emitted when you either logout from your websocket session or you have unsubscribed from the user data stream.   
* New event `externalLockUpdate` is sent when your spot wallet balance is locked/unlocked by an external system.

FIX API

* The [schema](https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/fix/schemas/spot-fix-oe.xml) has been updated with a new Administrative message News &lt;B&gt;, which can be used for all FIX services. Receiving this message indicates that your connection is about to be closed.
* **Note:** This message will be available in the live exchange at a later date.

### 2024-04-04 

General changes:

* Symbol permission information in Exchange Information responses has moved from field `permissions` to field `permissionSets`.
* Field `permissions` will be empty and will be removed in a future release.
* Previously, `"permissions":["SPOT","MARGIN"]` meant that you could place an order on the symbol if your account had `SPOT` or `MARGIN` permissions. The equivalent is `"permissionSets":[["SPOT","MARGIN"]]`. (Note the extra set of square brackets.) Each array of permissions inside the `permissionSets` array is called a "permission set".
* Symbol permissions can now be more complex. `"permissionSets":[["SPOT","MARGIN"],["TRD_GRP_004","TRD_GRP_005"]]` means that you may place an order on the symbol if your account has SPOT or MARGIN permissions **and** `TRD_GRP_004` or `TRD_GRP_005` permissions. There may be an arbitrary number of permission sets in a symbol's `permissionSets`.
* **The weight of the following requests has increased from 10 to 25**: 
	* `GET /api/v3/trades`
	* `GET /api/v3/historicalTrades`
	* `trades.recent`
	* `trades.historical`

REST API

* The `POST /api/v3/order/oco` endpoint is now deprecated on the REST API. You should use the new `POST /api/v3/orderList/oco` endpoint instead. Note that this new endpoint uses different parameters.
* `POST /api/v3/order/oco` has been removed from the Rest API documentation for SPOT Testnet.
* `otoAllowed` will now appear on `GET /api/v3/exchangeInfo`, that indicates if One-Triggers-the-Other (OTO) orders are supported on that symbol.

WebSocket API

* The `orderList.place` request is now deprecated on the WebSocket API. You should now use the new `orderList.place.oco` request instead. Note that this new request uses different parameters.
* `orderList.place` has been removed from the WebSocket API documentation for SPOT Testnet.
* `otoAllowed` will now appear on `exchangeInfo`, that indicates if One-Triggers-the-Other (OTO) orders are supported on that symbol.

SBE

* A new schema 2:0 [spot_2_0.xml](https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/sbe/schemas/spot_2_0.xml) has been released for SPOT Testnet. The current schema, 1:0 [spot_1_0.xml](https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/becd4d44a09d94821d2dc761ba9197aae8b495c3/sbe/schemas/spot_1_0.xml), will thus be deprecated and retired from the Testnet APIs in 6 months as per our schema deprecation policy.
* When using schema 1:0 on REST API or WebSocket API, group "permissions" in message "ExchangeInfoResponse" will always be empty. Upgrade to schema 2:0 to find permission information in group "permissionSets". See General changes above for more details.
* Responses for deprecated OCO requests are supported by both schema 1:0 and 2:0
